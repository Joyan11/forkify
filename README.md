# forkify
forkify is a recipe application built with vanilla JavaScript that interacts with the [forkify-api](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/) to fetch and display recipe food data. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Webpack to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7 and ES8 back to ES5. The user can search for a specific recipe, add ingredients to a shopping list and like the recipe and save it to a favourites list via local storage.
